# Trendyol Link Converter

## Architectural Approaches
 * Clean Architecture, details: https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html
 * CQRS, details: https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html#:~:text=CQRS%20stands%20for%20Command%20Query,you%20use%20to%20read%20information.
 * Mediatr, details: https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/mediator
 * Event handling demostration for microservices.

## How To Run
 * It is a Swagger implemented api, so when you run the application swagger page will ve opened. You can check out the endpoints.
 * I used Postgresql to prevent any database connection problems. You will not have any problems with a computer with Postgres installed. 
 * If you want to run the project, run **dotnet watch run** command at webapi layer.
 * DB and migrations will be created automatically.

 ## Notes
 * I haven't built any ui because you are testing me for my backend.
 * As you know, you assigned me with the tasks of web url to deep link conversion and deep link to web url conversion services.
 * Simply, I tried to simulate. I hope to talk about it together.
 * I gave importance to architecture and code quality. You will see this when you examine it :)
